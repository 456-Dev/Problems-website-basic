## QR Code Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Website URL
After deploying to Vercel or another platform, you'll have a URL like:
- `https://questiontheday.vercel.app`
- `https://your-custom-domain.com`

### Step 3: Customize QR Code
For better brand recognition:

- Test the QR code before printing!

## Printing Tips

### Print Specs
- **Size**: Standard business card (3.5" x 2")
- **Format**: CMYK color mode
- **Resolution**: 300 DPI minimum
- **Bleed**: 0.125" (ask your printer)

### Recommended Printers
- **Online**: VistaPrint, Moo, GotPrint
- **Local**: FedEx Office, Staples
- **Premium**: Moo (nice thick cards with custom finishes)

### Quantity Suggestions
- Start with 100-250 cards
- Reorder when you have ~20 left

## What to Say When Handing Out Cards

### Option 1: Before the Interview
> "Thanks for participating! Scan this QR code to watch previous episodes. Your episode will be up in 24 hours!"

### Option 2: After the Interview  
> "Your video will be live tomorrow! Check out the site to see what others have answered. Your episode drops in 24 hours!"

### Option 3: Casual
> "Scan this to see other people's answers. Yours will be on there tomorrow too!"

## Tracking Engagement

### Short URLs (Optional)
Use a URL shortener with analytics:
- **Bit.ly**: Track clicks, see when people scan
- **TinyURL**: Simple and free
- **yourDomain.com/qtd**: Custom short link

Then create a QR code from the short URL to track:
- How many people scan
- When they scan (right away vs later)
- Where they're from

### Analytics Setup
In your website, you can add:
- Google Analytics
- Vercel Analytics (built-in)
- Facebook Pixel (if you have a FB page)

This tells you:
- How many visitors from QR codes
- How long they stay
- Which videos they watch

## Making It More Engaging

### Add a Call-to-Action
Consider adding text like:
- ✅ "Think you could answer better? Watch and judge!"
- ✅ "See what others said!"
- ✅ "Your turn is next!"

### Include Social Proof
If you have followers:
- "Join 10K+ viewers"
- "Watch 100+ episodes"
- "New question every day"

### Create Urgency
- "Your episode drops in 24hrs!"
- "Watch before yours goes live"
- "See if you'd answer the same way"
